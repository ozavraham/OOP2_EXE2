// Assignment //
Writing a program which reciving input array from the user (Integer or String) and sending it to Generic HeapSort class.
HeapSort class "creating" a Heap from the given array, and sorts it according to the algorithm.

// Goal //
Use our new knowledge in Java programming and implement Generic Heapsort.

// Classes //
Main : Runs the program, Getting user's input and sending it to the Heapsort.
HeapSort : Geting the input and implements the Heapsort on the given array.
Other files attached: Readme.txt

// Definitions // 
Hapify: Heapify function is use to check whom between the two sons of specifc node is larger/smaller then the current node,
And according to the result swap the correct position, in order to create Min/Max heap.

// Running the program //
1. Navigate to Start -> run
2. Enter cmd in the commend line
3. Set the path to your JDK bin directory, for example: set path= "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161\bin". 
4. Extract the zip file to your desktop.
5. At the run window enter the project source folder likewise: cd JavaEclipseWorkspace/Oz1
6. Type: javac Main.java (Wait for the compiler to finish compiling...)
7. Type: java Main and follow the instuctions and enjoy your calculations.
